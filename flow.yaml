FlowSpecification:
  - On startup, create a GameObject with a target frame rate of 120 FPS.
  - GameObject Initialization:
    - Initialize the Raylib window with the specified title and size.
    - Set the target FPS for the game loop.
    - Initialize the Box2D physics world.
    - Set up physics time step settings.
    - Initialize the NodeManager to handle game nodes.
    - Initialize any resource manager
    - Load necessary resources (textures, sounds, etc.).
    - Setup Actions Manager and build input mappings.
  - Node Creation:
    - Create and configure game nodes as needed.
    - Set up parent-child relationships between nodes.
    - Ensure that each node's global transform is correctly calculated based on its parent's transform.
    - Set an initial Root Node in the NodeManager.
  
  - MainLoop:
    - processRelationships
    - build processList and drawList
    - get delta
    - update physics
    - process current node tree
    - draw current node tree
